# Mynth Smart Contracts

This repository hosts information related to Mynth’s smart contracts.
Mynth is a cross-chain swap protocol, so its smart contracts may span
multiple blockchains. Mynth’s smart contracts utilize a polyrepo
structure, so this repository only links to other repositories rather
than contains any source code itself.
